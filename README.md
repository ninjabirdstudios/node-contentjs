node-contentjs
==============

A streamlined, minimalistic game content pipeline built on Node.js. The library
and tools can be set up to monitor multiple source directory trees for changes,
and on command, execute data compilers for each modified file. The intent is to
provide rapid iteration for game content while minimizing errors that might
result from manually running a series of separate tools.

TODOs
-----

The following items remain TBD or fixed:

 * Need to implement a sample data compiler that does something more than just
   copy the input file to the target directory.
 * Need to implement the clean tool to delete all target packages.
